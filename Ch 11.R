        )

# (3) Understanding Labels with Facets

      #When you use geom_text() with faceting, the data is split by the facets, 
      #so labels will be placed accordingly. 
      #To add a label to a single facet, we can filter the data for that facet 
      #To put a different label in each facet, we can include a variable in the label aesthetic thats different from other ones. 
      
      #Here's an example:
      ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
        geom_point() +
        facet_wrap(~ drv) +
        geom_text(aes(label = paste(drv, "label")), data = mpg)


# (4) Appearance of geom_label() backgrounds

      #the arguments to geom_text() that control of the backgroud box are:
      #fill, color, label.size, and label.padding

# (5) Exploring the arrow() function in geom_segment()

      #The four arguments to arrow() are:
      # type, angle, length, ends

# Load extra libraries
library(scales)
library(hexbin) 

# (1) Why doesnâ€™t the following code override the default scale?

      # The issue here is that geom_hex() uses fill instead of color.

# (2) What is the first argument to every scale? How does it compare to labs()?

      #scale_*() functions set both labels and other properties for a specific aesthetic (like color or axis). 
      #for example, scale_x_continuous(name = "Engine Size (L)") changes the x-axis label. 
      #however, labs() is a simpler function that only sets labels for multiple aesthetics, like labs(x = "Engine Size (L)", color = "Drive Type").
