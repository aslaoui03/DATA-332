#1) 
#To count the number of missing values in a variable (say, dep_time), 
#we can use count() with is.na() like this:
  flights |> 
  count(is.na(dep_time))
  
#2) 
  #original:
  flights |> count(dest, sort = TRUE)
  #expanded:
    flights |> 
    group_by(dest) |> 
    summarize(n = n()) |> 
    arrange(desc(n))
  #original:
  flights |> count(tailnum, wt = distance)
  #expanded: 
    flights |> 
    group_by(tailnum) |> 
    summarize(n = sum(distance, na.rm = TRUE))
